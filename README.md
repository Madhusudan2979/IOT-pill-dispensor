# ESP32-Firebase-Connection

This repository contains an MIT App Inventor app and ESP32 code to establish a connection between an ESP32 device and Google Firebase (Realtime Database).

## Overview

The project aims to facilitate communication between an ESP32 microcontroller and a Firebase Realtime Database using an MIT App Inventor app. The ESP32 device sends data to the Firebase database, and the app retrieves and displays this data in real-time.

## Components

- `App`: Contains the MIT App Inventor project files.
- `ESP32`: Contains the Arduino sketch for the ESP32 microcontroller.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- [MIT App Inventor](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/)

Additionally, you'll need:

- An ESP32 development board.
- Access to Google Firebase. You'll need to create a Firebase project and set up a Realtime Database.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ESP32-Firebase-Connection.git
